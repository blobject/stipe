*** about

A basic file-based blog engine written in rust, with the help of
[[https://actix.rs/][actix]],
[[https://github.com/rust-ammonia/ammonia][ammonia]],
[[https://crates.io/crates/chrono][chrono]],
[[https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark][pulldown-cmark]],
[[https://crates.io/crates/rand][rand]], and
[[https://crates.io/crates/regex][regex]].

Posts are in markdown format and are flat (one level deep).

The engine's original implementation [[https://github.com/blobject/stipe/tree/clojure][in clojure]] had to be abandoned due to memory limitations in deployment.

*** use

- Start by placing all markdown files (eg. your individual blog posts) into a folder situated at =db/=. The filenames should end in =.md=, and each file can include metadata at the very top, with the format:
    #+BEGIN_SRC markdown
    key0: value0
    key1: value10, value11, ...
    :::
    Lorem ipsum ...
    #+END_SRC
  - *Important!* End the metadata declaration with a dinkus,
    - where a dinkus is a line consisting of only colons and spaces and at least one 3-colon sequence (for example, " : ::: ::::: ::: :").
    - A page with no metadata should have a dinkus as the first line.
  - The =time= key takes the page creation time, in seconds-since-unix-epoch.
  - The =tag= key takes a comma-separated list of strings, representing the tags associated with the blog post.
  - The =script= key takes a comma-separated list of filenames (relative to ~pub/js/~), which get appended as ~<script>~ lines to the ~<head>~ block.
  - The metadata are parsed manually, but for the parsing of the rest of the file (ie. the post itself), see [[https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark][pulldown-cmark]] and [[https://spec.commonmark.org/][commonmark]].

- example, /db\slash{}neuromancer.md:/
    #+BEGIN_SRC markdown
    title: Neuromancer (William Gibson)
    time: 457488001
    tag: Science Fiction, Cyberpunk
    script: wintermute.min.js
    
    :::
    
    <h1>Part 1, Chiba City Blues</h1>
    
    ## 1
    
    The sky above the port was the color of ...
    #+END_SRC

- Execute the server with ~cargo run~ or ~cargo run --release~.
